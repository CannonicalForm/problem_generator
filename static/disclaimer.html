    Note that currently this site is in an extreme alpha phase, as testing
    has only just begun on it. Any bugs, issues, complaints, etc. should
    be submitted via <a href="http://github.com/CannonicalForm/problem-generator">github</a> presently. Since that is where the code is hosted, it will
    be easier for me to track your issues.

    A final point of note is that most users probably will find there way
    here on the recomendation of a Navy recruiter, as an extra resource to
    help improve math skills. It should go without saying that I can in no
    way guarentee that this site will be of any assistance in preparing you
    for the ASVAB. Further, this site is in no way meant to be a replacement
    for traditional study methods available for the ASVAB, which were
    most likely prepared by individuals far more knowledgeble than myself.
